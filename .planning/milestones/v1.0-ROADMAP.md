# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-08
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Brownfield project completion: connected React frontend to Bookerville API via Laravel backend, wired search/booking flows, polished design with dark theme, and prepared for production deployment. Three phases followed the critical path: API connection first, then search/booking, then polish/deploy.

## Phases

### Phase 1: API Connection & Data Wiring

**Key deliverables:**
- API service layer with native fetch
- Custom useApi hook for data fetching
- LoadingSpinner and ErrorMessage components

**Completed:** 2026-02-07

### Phase 2: Search, Availability & Booking Flow

**Goal**: Users can search by dates, filter results, and complete booking via Airbnb redirect
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Wire search bar to API and Properties page with search params
- [x] 02-02: Wire Book Now to Airbnb redirect and connect email forms

### Phase 3: Design Polish & Deployment

**Goal**: Production-ready site with professional design matching mastervacationhomes.com quality
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Configure design system foundation, remove Resorts, implement dual footer, polish all pages with dark theme and mobile-first responsiveness
- [x] 03-02: Configure production build and create comprehensive deployment guide for Railway

**Key deliverables:**
- Dark color palette (dark-900 through dark-600) via Tailwind extend
- Montserrat headings + Poppins body typography
- Starfield canvas background animation
- Resorts removed from navigation (files kept for rollback)
- Dual footer: SimpleFooter on Home, FullFooter elsewhere

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Quick depth (3 phases) to ship same day
- Same-origin serving (Laravel serves React build) to avoid CORS
- Native fetch over axios/react-query for simplicity
- URL params for search state (shareable links)
- Airbnb notice above Book Now for clear UX messaging
- Starfield animation + dark palette + Montserrat/Poppins typography
- Dual footer system (SimpleFooter on Home, FullFooter elsewhere)
- Resorts removed from nav (files kept for rollback)
- Railway over Cloudways (instant signup, no verification wait)

**Issues Resolved:**
- flatpickr disable function needed array wrapping to fix TypeError
- API response shapes required frontend wiring adjustments
- Legacy HTML files conflicted with SPA routing (moved to _legacy/)
- Homepage required several layout iterations for proper centering
- Airbnb IDs needed population and wiring through API to frontend

**Issues Deferred:**
- Exposed API credentials in .env.example (security — document in deployment)
- CORS wildcard in config/cors.php (tighten for production domain)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- CORS wildcard needs tightening for production domain
- API credentials exposure in .env.example should be cleaned
