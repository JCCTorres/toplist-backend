# Roadmap: Top List Property Manager

## Milestones

- SHIPPED **v1.0 MVP** — Phases 1-3 (shipped 2026-02-08) → [Archive](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md)
- **v1.1 Enhancements** — Phase 4+ (in progress)

## Current Milestone: v1.1 Enhancements

### Phase 4: Improve Price Displayed Accuracy

**Goal:** Display accurate total stay prices including cleaning fees, taxes, and estimated Airbnb service fees, so guests have realistic price expectations before redirecting to Airbnb checkout.
**Depends on:** Phase 3
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Backend PriceCalculatorService and API endpoint
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Frontend PriceBreakdown component and PropertyDetails integration
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — PropertyCard pricing display

**Details:**
Currently the site shows only base nightly rates. Actual vacation rental costs are typically 20-60% above base rate when cleaning fees, taxes, and Airbnb service fees are included. This phase adds a backend price calculation service that computes estimated totals, and frontend components to display the breakdown.
